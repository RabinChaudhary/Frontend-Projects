          <p>
            C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a
            days ' for competitive programming. It has imperative,
            object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots
            of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc. C++ is an efficient
            and powerful language and finds wide use in various GUI platforms,
            3D graphics and real-time simulations. Because of the inclusion of
            rich function libraries, working in C++ becomes simpler and
            convenient than C. Being object-oriented programming like Java, C++
            provides the support of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation,
            etc. Unlike C, C++ allows exception handling and function
            overloading.

            he “Hello World” program is the first step towards learning any
            programming language and also one of the simplest programs you will
            learn. All you have to do is display the message “Hello World” on
            the screen.

            Object-oriented programming – As the name suggests uses objects in
            programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement
            real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in
            programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and
            the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code
            can access this data except that function.
          </p>

                Inheritance
            </header>
            <p>
                The capability of a class to derive
                properties and characteristics from
                another class is called Inheritance.
                Inheritance is one of the most important
                feature of Object Oriented Programming.
                Sub Class: The class that inherits
                properties from another class
                is called Sub class or Derived Class.
                Super Class: The class whose properties
                are inherited by sub class is called Base
                Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we
                have to write the functions only one time
                instead of three times as we
                have inherited rest of the three classes
                from base class(Vehicle).

                Polymorphism
            </header>
            <p>
                The word polymorphism means having many
                forms. In simple words, we can define
                polymorphism as the ability of a message
                to be displayed in more than one form.
                A real-life example of polymorphism, a
                person at the same time can have
                different characteristics.
                Like a man at the same time is a father,
                a husband, an employee. So the same
                person posses different behavior in
                different situations. This is called
                polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
                as one of the important features of Object
                Oriented Programming.
                <br>
                <b>In C++ polymorphism is mainly
                    divided into two types:</b>
                <br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>
                2. Runtime Polymorphism
            </p>
            <p>Compile time polymorphism: This type of
                polymorphism is achieved by function
                overloading or operator overloading.
                <br> Runtime polymorphism: This type
                of polymorphism is achieved by
                Function Overriding.

                Abstraction
            </header>

            <p>
                Data abstraction is one of the most
                essential and important feature of object
                oriented programming in C++. Abstraction
                means displaying only essential information
                and hiding the details. Data abstraction
                refers to providing only essential information
                about the data to the outside world,
                hiding the background details or implementation.
                <br> Consider a real life example of a man driving
                a car. The man only knows that pressing the
                accelerators will increase the speed of car
                or applying brakes will stop the car but he
                does not know about how on pressing accelerator
                the speed is actually increasing, he does
                not know about the inner mechanism of the car
                or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
                etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
                <p>
                    <b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can
                    implement Abstraction in C++ using classes.
                    Class helps us to group data members and member
                    functions using available access specifiers. A
                    Class can decide which data member will be
                    visible to outside
                    world and which is not.
                    <br>
                    <b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One
                    more type of abstraction in C++ can be
                    header files. For example, consider the
                    pow() method present in math.h header file.
                    Whenever we need to calculate power of a
                    number, we simply call the
                    function pow() present in the math.h header
                    file and pass the numbers as arguments
                    without knowing the underlying algorithm
                    according to which the function is actually
                    calculating power of numbers.
                    <br><br><b>Advantages of Data Abstraction:
  
                    </b><br> 1. Helps the user to avoid writing
                    the low level code.<br> 2. Avoids code.

                Encapsulation
            </header>
            <p>
                In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
                as wrapping up of data and information
                under a single unit. In Object Oriented
                Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
                binding together the data and the functions
                that manipulates them. Consider
                a real life example
                of encapsulation, in a company there are
                different sections like the accounts section,
                finance section, sales section etc. The finance
                section handles all the financial transactions
                and keep records of all the data related to
                finance.
                <code>DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
                    DB_DATABASE=/absolute/path/to/database.sqlite</code>
                
                Similarly the sales section handles all the
                sales related activities and keep records of
                all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
                when for some reason an official from finance
                section needs all the data about sales in a
                particular
                month.
                <code>'mysql' => [
                    'read' => [
                        'host' => [
                            '192.168.1.1',
                            '196.168.1.2',
                        ],
                    ],
                    'write' => [
                        'host' => [
                            '196.168.1.3',
                        ],
                    ],
                    'sticky' => true,
                    'driver' => 'mysql',
                    'database' => 'database',
                    'username' => 'root',
                    'password' => '',
                    'charset' => 'utf8mb4',
                    'collation' => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci',
                    'prefix' => '',
                ],</code> In this case, he is not allowed to
                directly access the data of sales section.
                He will first have to contact some other
                officer in the sales section and then
                request him to
                give the particular data. This is what
                encapsulation is. Here the data of
                sales section and the
                employees that can manipulate them are
                wrapped under a single name “sales section”.
            </p>

            <p>
                Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction
                or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides
                the data. In the above example the data of
                any of the section like sales, finance or
                accounts is hidden from any other section.<br>
                In C++ encapsulation
                can be implemented using Class
                and access modifiers.
